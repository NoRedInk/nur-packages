# nur-packages

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/NoRedInk/nur-packages.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/NoRedInk/nur-packages)

This repo is for storing Nix expressions used by multiple internal repositories at NoRedInk.

It follows the **[NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) repository** pattern for ease of understanding.

Once a package is in use for a while and has been stable, it should be pushed [upstream](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) so that the community at large can benefit from having it officially available as a Nix package.
